# CSS IN REACT

## Internal styling

- To add internal style , we first of all have to use a style attribute and then enclose the css properties within an object .
- or you can make an object seperately and then add it in the attribute value .

## External styling

- So , to add external styling on a global level , we have to add those in index.css .
- This is because , index.css refers to the code at a global level .

**Note : Do make sure that all the css properties that you are trying to give should follow camelCasing**
