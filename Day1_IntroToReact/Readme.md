# Reactjs

- It is a fronted library
- frontend -> for the clients .
- library -> a set of written code/files.
- React makes development faster .
- It is the most popular libraries amongst the developers .
- because it is popular , it has a huge developer community .
- React was developed by facebook (Meta) , it is backed by a huge orgainization.
- Future is safe .
- React uses a concept of re-usuability of code .

## Library vs Framework

- React (Library) vs Angular (Framewrok).
- Libraray is small in size
- framework is large in size .
- React is faster with angular (or any framework).
- in framework , many things are built-up.
- in library , it contains the basic code.
- Libraries just contain the bare minimum code to get you started .

**Note We will be using Node js in this course**

## Getting started with React

- We want node js.
- After Node js is installed , we create a folder .
- then we execute a command -> npx create-react-app demo.

**There is alternate to npm , that is yarn**

## Directory Structure

- node_modules - This is a directory/folder which contains all the modules/packages that we are using . This is really big . We never share it . These packages are used for better execution / deveolpment of the react application .
- Public - This directory contains all the files that are to be shown to the public .

  - favicon.ico - This is the icon that the shown next to the title.
  - index.html - This is the main file.
  - manifext.json - This is more like a metadeta for the website .
  - robots.txt - for SEO purpose .

- src - This folder cotains the source code .
- .gitignore - This is used for git and github . It tells which files we have to ignore .
- package.json - This is where we mention our project name, version, description etc. will the there.
- package-lock.json - This is the extended version of package.json .
- Readme.md - This is markdown file , used for documentation for humans to read .


**Note : We will be using camelCasing**

## Npx
- Npx is just a node package executor.
- It is just used to execute any package.

## CRA
- Create-react-app
- it is also a third developed by Meta.
- we don't need this package , we can write the same exact code on our own.
- but if we use this package , it saves us time as well a efforts.
